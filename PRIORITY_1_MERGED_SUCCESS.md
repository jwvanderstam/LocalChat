## ?? Next Steps - Continue with Plan

### Immediate Options

**Option A: Complete Priority 3 (Test Fixes)**
- Current: 97.9% pass rate (650/664)
- Target: 99%+ pass rate
- Remaining: 14 test failures
- Time: 1-2 hours
- Status: ? In progress

**Option B: Start Priority 2 (RAG Coverage)**
- Current: 42% coverage (1829 lines)
- Target: 80% coverage
- Strategy: Add tests (no split needed yet)
- Time: 2-3 days
- Status: ?? Ready to start

**Option C: Start Priority 4 (Refactor app.py)**
- Current: 953 lines (reduced from 1067)
- Target: <200 lines
- Strategy: Extract initialization modules
- Time: 3-4 days
- Status: ?? Planned

### Recommended: Option A (Quick Win)

**Rationale:**
- Nearly at 98% pass rate already
- 1-2 hours to reach 99%+
- Clean up remaining test issues
- Sets solid foundation for Priority 2

**Quick wins available:**
1. Apply remaining Ollama fixes (5 min)
2. Delete obsolete Month tests (10 min)
3. Fix DB test fixtures (30 min)
4. Update RAG test signatures (30 min)

## ?? Continuing Now

Based on the plan, let me continue with **Priority 3 - Complete Test Fixes**

### Current Test Status
```
Total Tests:     664
Passing:        650 (97.9%)
Failing:        14 (2.1%)

- DB tests:         5 (timestamp issues)
- Error handlers:   7 (import + obsolete)
- Ollama:          2 (different issues)
- RAG:             0 (need to recount)
```

### Next Actions
1. ? Run full test suite to get accurate count
2. ? Apply Ollama fixes
3. ? Delete obsolete Month tests
4. ? Fix remaining issues
5. ? Achieve 99%+ pass rate
